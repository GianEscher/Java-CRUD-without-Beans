# Java-CRUD-without-Beans
Shapeless approach using ArrayList objects to manipulate basic data in a local Mysql server. 
The main objective here is to eliminate the need for multiple CRUD beans in applications with several tables, each with a different structure.
In exchange for some complexity added to the system, i tried to universalize my acess to CRUD methods, thus removing redundant code and extracting the power and versatility of Generics in Java.
